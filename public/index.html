      <p>
        In 2020, I started my IT yourney at Fontys. They showed me some different workfields in IT during the first
        semester and in the end py preference was at software engineering, and that's what I have been doing from
        that moment forward. The goal of creating this portfolio
        is to create a summary of my Software Engineering yourney.

          <p>
            In my first semester I learned my first programming language: C#. During this semester
            I learned about programming
            by making practical assignments, by making an application that converts euros to dollars
            for example.

          <p>
            After making more of these little assignments i made my final project of
            my first semester. It is a shopping system that has a shopping cart and
            check out simulation.

            In the second half of the first semester I participated in a group project
            where I made a electronic learning enviroment for schools with 5 other classmates. In
            this assignment we made a class diagram for our .NET OOP application.
            This assignment also was the first time that I worked with a database.

          <p>
            In semester 2 of the study, i wrote a program that sorts circus animals into train wagons
            in the most efficcient way, without braking any of the given rules. My application
            designing skills improved a lot because of this exercice.

          <p>
            In semester 2 I had my first encounter with UI design and multi-layered applications.
            I made an app that can be used to keep track of the dreams you had and
            see the dreams your friends had.

          <p>
            In semester 2 I also did a group project for the company philips, we made
            a distributed application with a typescript frontend and typescript backend,
            those layers communicate through express. During this project I also learned how to
            write unit tests.

          <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">Ninja Game</h3>
          <p>
            In my third semester I made a web application with python, Django, Node and VueJs.
            For this distributed web app I made one frontend application with Vuejs and two different
            Django backends. One for handling user authentication and the saving of used data, and the
            other one as my game server. This game server uses a websocket for fast back and forth
            communication between client and server.
            My software testing skills improved a lot during this project, I wrote unit, integration and e2e tests.
            I used cypress to test my frontend. All of these tests where automatically run after pushing changes to
            my github repository because of the CI/CD configuration I set up there.
